# BankBot
The purpose of this app is to help the user find the bank that suits his needs best. It considers all the aspects that are relevant for the user and determines what offer represents the best trade-off.

## The challenge
This app developed during the Hack The Burgh VI hackathon, using an API provided by Barclays within their challenge.

## Inspiration
Apart from the challenge issued by Barclays, a source of inspiration was our own experience with banking. There are a lot of factors to take into consideration when choosing a bank and any piece of advice is valuable.

## What it does
The app is basically a chat bot that requests certain data from the user, analyses their preferences and suggests a bank that might be suitable.

## How I built it
The app was built in Python, using the PyQt library for the GUI, with some help from the Qt Designer for the layout.

## Challenges I ran into
Our initial attempt was to train an AI, so the communication would be more valuable. However, due to the lack of experience we found this difficult, so we decided to build a rule-based chat bot.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
I am proud of the way I managed to tackle the challenges I went through and of my endurance, as I managed to develop an app in 24 hours without sleeping

## What I learned
I learned about GUI and threads, about different types of chat bots and about the challenges that this area is confronting with

## What's next for BankBot
The next step is to make a deeper analysis of different bank offers, so the advice would become more valuable. In the future, it would be very nice to implement natural language processing and machine learning in order to enhance the experience of the user.

# Running
The main file of this app is 'driver.py'. PyQt4 is required to run it.
